# CollabCam

**CollabCam** is a dynamic web platform built to facilitate **online coding interviews**. Designed to streamline the interview process, CollabCam provides a collaborative environment that integrates real-time coding, video monitoring, and chat tools. Interviewers can start a session, share a unique session code with candidates, and conduct an interactive interview that closely mirrors an in-person coding test.

## Key Features

### Collaborative Code Editor  
- Live coding editor where candidates write, edit, and debug code directly in the session.  
- Real-time updates let interviewers observe the candidate’s approach, provide instant feedback, and guide them through challenges seamlessly.

### Video Monitoring  
- Ensures integrity and focus with head-movement tracking.  
  - **Warning** issued if excessive movement is detected.  
  - Continued movement after a warning may **terminate the session**, maintaining a controlled environment.

### In-Session Chat  
- Built-in chat for seamless communication.  
- Perfect for discussing tasks, offering hints, or resolving technical issues instantly.

> **Note:** Currently, CollabCam is optimized for users on the same network due to limitations of the current PeerJS setup. We plan to expand support so that anyone can connect from any network globally.

## Future Roadmap

- **Session Management:** Conduct multiple back-to-back interviews without resetting the platform
- **Scoring & Feedback:** Allow interviewers to assign scores, write feedback, and keep performance logs across sessions.
